# NgSwissArmyKnife

This library provides common Tools, Helpers, Directives, Components, Services and Pipes
that are often used in different angular projects.

So it should be a swiss army knife for angular developers ;-D

_If you find something missing or have suggestions please let me know._

I work on different angular projects and will update this library frequently.
