component of every angular component\nIt uses OnInit and OnDestroy, so remember to call super.ngOnInit() at first\nif you also use OnInit in the child class\nIn nearly every angular component you will subscribe to something\nand the best approach to unsubscribe is: takeUntil\ntakeUntil the component gets destroyed\ne.g.:\ntimer(1000).pipe(\n  takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n  tap(() => do something)\n).subscribe();\nso this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\nwhich you can subscribe to.\ne.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\nsubscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\nit' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\nat in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        OnDestroy\n                        OnInit\n            \n\n

takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n *  tap(() => do something)\n * ).subscribe();\n *\n * so this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\n * which you can subscribe to.\n *\n * e.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\n * subscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\n * it' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\n * at in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n *\n * @Input() someVar;\n * constructor() {\n *   this.onInit$().subscribe(() =>
