component of every angular component\nIt uses OnInit and OnDestroy, so remember to call super.ngOnInit() at first\nif you also use OnInit in the child class\nIn nearly every angular component you will subscribe to something\nand the best approach to unsubscribe is: takeUntil\ntakeUntil the component gets destroyed\ne.g.:\ntimer(1000).pipe(\n  takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n  tap(() => do something)\n).subscribe();\nso this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\nwhich you can subscribe to.\ne.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\nsubscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\nit' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\nat in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        OnDestroy\n                        OnInit\n

                 \n\nNgSwissArmyKnife\nThis library provides common Tools, Helpers, Directives, Components, Services and Pipes\nthat are often used in different angular projects.\nSo it should be a swiss army knife for angular developers ;-D\nBut it also contains a lot of useful stuff for just javascript developers or css styling\nIf you find something missing or have suggestions please let me know.\nI work on different angular projects and will update this library frequently.\nInstallation\nrun  npm i ng-swiss-army-knife --save\nAPI\nBaseClasses\nStatefulObject\nIf you are fed up about implementing a whole Redux solution, this might be your bet.\nIt's a simple solution to have a stateful object that should be immutable.\nYou can use it as a base class for a state of your own.\ne.g.:\nUsing the Class as it is as a global state service \n@Injectable({\n    providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class MyStateService extends StatefulObject {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.setState({name: 'Nick', age: 40});\n    }    \n}\n\nexport interface MyState {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n}\nexport class MyComponecnt {\n    constructor(state: MyStateService) {\n        state.state$.subscribe(newState => {\n            // do something with the new state\n        });\n        // Set partial state\n        state.setState({\n            name: 'Tom'\n        });\n    }\n}or maybe with a more complex state you can provide your own getter setter methods\n@Injectable({\n    providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class MyStateService extends StatefulObject {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.setState({\n            name: 'Nick', \n            age: 40, \n            settings: {\n                language: 'en'\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    setLanguage(lang: string) {\n        this.setState({\n            settings: {\n                ...this.stateSnapshot.settings,\n                language: lang\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    getLanguage(): string {\n        return this.stateSnapshot.settings.language;\n    }\n\n    getLanguage$() {\n        return this.state$.map(s => s.settings.language);\n    }\n}\n\nexport interface StateSettings {\n    language: string;\n}\nexport interface MyComplexState {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n    settings: StateSettings;\n}\nexport class MyComponecnt {\n    constructor(state: MyStateService) {\n        state.state$.subscribe(newState => {\n            // do something with the new state\n        });\n        // Set partial state\n        state.setLanguage('de');\n    }\n}You see, you can mess around like you wish, it's really just\na simple base class for those who either want it quick and (not so) dirty\nor make a nice StateService out of it without implementing comples redux libraries.\nPipes:\nroundNumber pipe\ntakes one argument, the digits to round the number\ne.g. {{0.123123 | roundNumber:2}}\nSCSS Styles:\nYou can include the atoms.scss to be able to do atom-styling, meaning\nyou have one css class for one styling property, e.g.:\n\nAngular Typescript:\nClick here for the full documentation\nUsage\nFor simplicity you can typ SwissArmyKnife anywhere\nin your application and the intellisense will show you\neverything that the knife has to offer.\n\n(technically we made a class with static members, so all\nthe helpers, services, etc. are at one place and you don't have\nto guess the names...)\nAlso you can find all the helpers if you typ Helper(dot)\nWe find this very handy, as you don't remember all the helper function\nnames if the are just loose.\n\nDevelopment\n\nWhen checkin to GIT run \"npm run compodoc\" before\nTo create a new version and automatically deploy to NPM: \n\nmanually update the version in the projects/ng-swiss-army-knife/package.json\nGIT Commit\n\"npm version NEW_VERSION\" in project root\n(git push --follow-tags may not work inside npm, then you have to type it manually)\nCommit and Push to Git\n\n\n\nbit4bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
