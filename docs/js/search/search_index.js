component of every angular component\nIt uses OnInit and OnDestroy, so remember to call super.ngOnInit() at first\nif you also use OnInit in the child class\nIn nearly every angular component you will subscribe to something\nand the best approach to unsubscribe is: takeUntil\ntakeUntil the component gets destroyed\ne.g.:\ntimer(1000).pipe(\n  takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n  tap(() => do something)\n).subscribe();\nso this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\nwhich you can subscribe to.\ne.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\nsubscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\nit' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\nat in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        OnDestroy\n                        OnInit\n

Services and Pipes\nthat are often used in different angular projects.\nSo it should be a swiss army knife for angular developers ;-D\nBut it also contains a lot of useful stuff for just javascript developers or css styling\nIf you find something missing or have suggestions please let me know.\nI work on different angular projects and will update this library frequently.\nInstallation\nrun  npm i ng-swiss-army-knife --save\nAPI\nForm Validators\ndateGreaterThan\nChecks if a date is greater than another (angular form controls)\n\nE.g.:\nthis.form = fb.group({\n      dateFrom: ['', [Validators.required]],\n      dateTo: ['']     \n    });\n\n    this.form.controls.dateTo.setValidators(\n      FormValidators.dateGreaterThan(this.form.controls.dateFrom,\n        (value: string) => new Date(value)));anyRequired\nChecks if any given FormControl has a value. This validator must  be used on form level, see\nhttps://angular.io/guide/form-validation#cross-field-validation\n\nE.g.:\nthis.form = fb.group({\n      dateFrom: ['', [Validators.required]],\n      dateTo: [''],\n      days: [0],\n      hours: [0],\n      minutes: [0],\n      timespanMode: ['timespanMinutesFromNow']\n    }, {\n      validators: [this.anyRequired(['days', 'hours', 'minutes'])]\n    });Classes\nCachedObservable\nHow many times you wanted a cached observable out of the box ?\nHere you have it.\nGive it a cache duration in seconds and the rest works automagically.\ne.g.:\nexport class ApiService {\n  myCachedApiCall$: CachedObservable;\n\n  constructor(protected http: HttpClient) {\n  }\n\n  getAllNames(): Observable {\n    if (!this.myCachedApiCall$) {\n      this.myCachedApiCall$ = new CachedObservable(60, // Cache for one  minute\n        this.http.get(`${environment.urls.apiUrl}/getAllNames`));\n    }\n\n    return this.myCachedApiCall$.getObservable();\n  }\n}For convenience there is also a cachedObservable service (see section services), which is even \nmore simpler to use.\nDirectives\nngIonSync\nThis is a workaround helper for Ionic4/5 using Angular-Reactive-Forms.\nIf you programmatically use the markAs*** functions on an angular form control it won't sync up to the ion-input or ion-item.\nThis attribute directive syncs these css classes as a workaround because it is still not working see:\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/20650\nShadowDomStyleDirective - Styling ShadowDom\nWith this directive you can style an element inside the shadow dom.\nThis is useful e.g. for Ionic Components which all hidden by the Shadow-Dom.\n\nUsage Example:\nFunctions\ncreateAutoIndexer\nWith this method you can merge 2 Objects properties. You have a main object and a an object that extends the  main object.\nThis is usefull if you want to implement an interface in a class but you don't want\nto copy and assign all the properties of the interface object.\nThen automagically all the properties of the anonymous interface object can be access through the merged\nobject and you can extend it.\nE.g.:\nexport class Container implements Partial {\n   constructor(private wrapped: IContainer) {\n   }\n\n   get fullPath(): string {\n     return !!this.wrapped.path ? this.wrapped.path + '.' + this.wrapped.id :\n       this.wrapped.id;\n   }\n\n   static create(wrapped: IContainer): Container {\n     return createAutoIndexer(new Container(wrapped), wrapped);\n   }\n }Services\nCachedObservableService\nHow many times you wanted a cache your api calls out of the box ?\nHere you have it.\nGive it a cache duration in seconds and the rest works automagically.\ne.g.:\nexport class ApiService {\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private CachedObservableService) {\n  }\n\n  getAllNames(): Observable {\n    return this.cache.getOrCreate('getAllNames', 60 * 15,\n      this.http.get(`${environment.urls.apiUrl}/getAllNames`));\n  }\n}PubSubService\nSimple publish/subscribe service.\nUserful for inter-component communication\nKeyValueStore\nIf you are fed up about implementing a whole Redux solution, this might be your bet.\nIt's a simple solution to have a key-value store that is synced to the localstorage.\ne.g.:\nexport interface Store {\n    darkMode: boolean;\n    language: string;\n}\n\n// Optionally you can define an initial store state\n// but if there is already something in the localstorage stored\n// it will be taken from the localstorage\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    {\n      provide: KeyValueStoreInitialValue,\n      useValue: {\n        darkMode: true,\n        language: 'de'\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n\nexport class MyComponent {\n    constructor(store: KeyValueStoreService) {\n        this.store.getValue$('language').subscribe(language => {\n          this.translate.use(language);\n        });\n\n        this.store.setValue('language', 'en');\n        const currentLang = this.store.getValue('language');\n\n        this.store.getValue$('darkMode').subscribe(darkMode => {\n          this.helper.toggleDarkTheme(darkMode);\n        });\n\n        this.store.getStore$().subscribe(store => {\n          console.log('saving to backend', store);\n        });\n\n        this.store.getAllChanges$().subscribe(change => {\n            console.log(`key ${change.key} changed from ${change.previousValue} to ${change.currentValue}`);\n        });\n\n        this.store.getValueChanges$('darkMode').subscribe(change => {\n            console.log(`darkMode changed from ${change.previousValue} to ${change.currentValue}`);\n        });\n    }    \n}I find this useful in nearly every project you need some simple key value solution which you can subscribe to\nand i find myself writing the same logic again when i don't want to implement\na whole store/redux solution which might be just over complicated or too much.\nPipes:\nroundNumber pipe\ntakes one argument, the digits to round the number\ne.g. {{0.123123 | roundNumber:2}}\nSCSS Styles:\nYou can include the atoms.scss to be able to do atom-styling, meaning\nyou have one css class for one styling property, e.g.:\n\nAngular Typescript:\nClick here for the full documentation\nUsage\nFor simplicity you can typ SwissArmyKnife anywhere\nin your application and the intellisense will show you\neverything that the knife has to offer.\n\n(technically we made a class with static members, so all\nthe helpers, services, etc. are at one place and you don't have\nto guess the names...)\nAlso you can find all the helpers if you typ Helper(dot)\nWe find this very handy, as you don't remember all the helper function\nnames if the are just loose.\n\nDevelopment\n\nWhen checkin to GIT run \"npm run compodoc\" before\nTo create a new version and automatically deploy to NPM: \n\nmanually update the version in the projects/ng-swiss-army-knife/package.json\nGIT Commit\n\"npm version NEW_VERSION\" in project root\n(git push --follow-tags may not work inside npm, then you have to type it manually)\nCommit and Push to Git\n\n\n\nbit4bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
