component of every angular component\nIt uses OnInit and OnDestroy, so remember to call super.ngOnInit() at first\nif you also use OnInit in the child class\nIn nearly every angular component you will subscribe to something\nand the best approach to unsubscribe is: takeUntil\ntakeUntil the component gets destroyed\ne.g.:\ntimer(1000).pipe(\n  takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n  tap(() => do something)\n).subscribe();\nso this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\nwhich you can subscribe to.\ne.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\nsubscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\nit' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\nat in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        OnDestroy\n                        OnInit\n            \n\n

takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n *  tap(() => do something)\n * ).subscribe();\n *\n * so this base class has no injector dependencies and provide the onDestroy$ and onInit$ observables\n * which you can subscribe to.\n *\n * e.g. you don't have to use OnInit in the subsclass you cann also just\n * subscribe to this.onInit$.subscribe() in the constructor\n * it' also useful if you want to access @Input variables which get set\n * at in onInit lifecycle and not in the constructor, so:\n *\n * @Input() someVar;\n * constructor() {\n *   this.onInit$().subscribe(() =>

Services and Pipes\nthat are often used in different angular projects.\nSo it should be a swiss army knife for angular developers ;-D\nIf you find something missing or have suggestions please let me know.\nI work on different angular projects and will update this library frequently.\nInstallation\nrun  npm i ng-swiss-army-knife --save\nUsage\nFor the full usage check out the documentation.\nBut for simplicity you can typ SwissArmyKnife anywhere\nin your application and the intellisense will show you\neverything that the knife has to offer.\n\n(technically we made a class with static members, so all\nthe helpers, services, etc. are at one place and you don't have\nto guess the names...)\nAlso you can find all the helpers if you typ Helper(dot)\nWe find this very handy, as you don't remember all the helper function\nnames if the are just loose.\n\nAPI\nClick here for the full documentation\nDevelopment\n\nWhen checkin to GIT run \"npm compodoc\" before\nTo create a new version
