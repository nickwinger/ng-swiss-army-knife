# NgSwissArmyKnife

This library provides common Tools, Helpers, Directives, Components, Services and Pipes
that are often used in different angular projects.

So it should be a swiss army knife for angular developers ;-D

_If you find something missing or have suggestions please let me know._

I work on different angular projects and will update this library frequently.
## Installation

run  `npm i ng-swiss-army-knife --save`

## API

[Click here for the full documentation](https://nickwinger.github.io/ng-swiss-army-knife/)

## Usage
For the full usage check out the documentation.
But for simplicity you can typ SwissArmyKnife anywhere
in your application and the intellisense will show you
everything that the knife has to offer.

(technically we made a class with static members, so all
the helpers, services, etc. are at one place and you don't have
to guess the names...)
Also you can find all the helpers if you typ Helper(dot)
We find this very handy, as you don't remember all the helper function
names if the are just loose.
